# Stratis

Stratis is a python-based framework for developing and testing strategies, inspired by the simplicity 
of tradingview's [Pinescript](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v5/Introduction.html).  Currently,
stratis is in the early stages of development, and is not yet ready for production use.  However, it is encouraged
to try it out and provide feedback via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/robswc/stratis/issues/new).
